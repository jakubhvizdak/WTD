# WTD

-- sorry for that commits, but I'm used to GitLab and it's a slightly different.

how to run a project:
1) download xampp from: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
2) launch xampp
3) turn apache on
4) pull repository from git to the (xampp) htdocs folder
5) copy http://localhost/WTD/index.html to your browser
